Thoses researchs are for educational purposes.
I like to learn and explore possibilities of devices that I purchase, that’s all.

Please note that I will not explain operations described in OP-Z user guides.
If you don’t know how to do something, please read the fun manual !
You will learn a lot about the device you just have bought.
